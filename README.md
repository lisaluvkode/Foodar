# Foodar
Foodar is a food delivery service application. Foodies will order take-out from a local restaurant, then use Foodar to find a Driver to pick up and deliver it to them. Delivery fees will be calculated based on distance driven, plus a base fee. Users must register a card to autopay drivers the approved amount.

Build by the static HTML and CSS content for all pages of the website as well as implement JavaScript to check if a particular zipcode is within the Foodar service area return a message to users notifying them of service availability.
